# Descriptive manager
I created this library to help me manage multiple [descriptive playlist](https://github.com/adinan-cenci/descriptive-playlist) files.  
Main features:

## Simultaneous editing
It allows me to have the same item in different playlists and updated all of them at the same time.

It does so by linking the differents items through the "`xxxOriginal`" custom property.

## Unified search
It allows me to search all the playlists without duplicated results ( see previous section ).
