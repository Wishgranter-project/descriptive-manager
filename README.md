# Descriptive manager
I created this library to help me manage multiple [descriptive playlist](https://github.com/adinan-cenci/descriptive-playlist) files.

In early development.

Main features:

## 1. Simultaneous editing
It allows us to have an item and multiple copies in different playlists and updated all of them at once.

It does so by linking all of them through the "`xxxOriginal`" [custom property](https://github.com/adinan-cenci/descriptive-playlist-definition/blob/master/technical-specifications.md#the-playlist-item-object).

## 2. Unified search
It allows me to search all the playlists without duplicated results ( see previous section ).
